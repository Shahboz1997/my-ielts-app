        <p>
          We collect your email address and name when you create an account. This is done through
          Google Sign-In or our email/password registration (NextAuth). We use this information only
          to manage your account, provide the service, and communicate with you about your usage
          (e.g. credits and subscription).

        <h2>AI processing</h2>
        <p>
          Your essays are sent to OpenAI&apos;s API to generate band scores and feedback. We do not use
          your essays or any student data to train our own models. OpenAI processes the content
          according to their data use policy; we do not retain essay content for model training
          purposes.
