        <p>
          If you purchase a subscription (e.g. monthly or yearly plan), you may cancel before the next
          billing cycle. Refunds for the current billing period are considered on a case-by-case basis
          and are not guaranteed. Subscription fees are generally non-refundable once the billing period
          has started. Contact us at{' '}
